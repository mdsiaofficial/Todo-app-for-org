What i have learned:
Creating the TODO-APP-FOR-ORG was an enriching experience that taught me a great deal about both technical and soft skills. On the technical front, I learned about the intricacies of full-stack development, from designing a user-friendly front-end interface using React to setting up a robust back-end with Node.js and Express. Implementing features like task prioritization and deadline tracking honed my skills in database management and querying, particularly with MongoDB.

Moreover, this project deepened my understanding of user experience (UX) design principles. Ensuring that the app was intuitive and met the users' needs required conducting user research and iterating on feedback, which was both challenging and rewarding.

On the soft skills side, this project improved my ability to work in a team. Collaborating with others on code, managing version control with Git, and navigating the complexities of merging code taught me the importance of clear communication and compromise. Additionally, leading some parts of the project enhanced my project management skills, including task delegation, time management, and setting realistic milestones.

Overall, the development of TODO-APP-FOR-ORG was a comprehensive learning journey that not only improved my technical abilities but also taught me valuable lessons in teamwork and project management.
